# TravelAggregatorAnalysis
• Utilized Python (pandas) to clean and preprocess large datasets from the Bookings.csv file,
performing operations like filtering, handling missing values, and aggregating data to prepare for
analysis.
• Leveraged SQL and Python to compute distinct counts of bookings, sessions, and searches, and
identified the sessions with more than one booking by grouping and analyzing session-level data.
• Created a heatmap and time series plots in Python to analyze booking patterns, including identifying
days of the week with the highest bookings and trends for device types over time, using Matplotlib
and Seaborn.
• Computed and visualized the average Booking to Search Ratio (BSR) on a monthly and weekly basis,
using Python to aggregate search and booking data, and plotted time series for BSR over all available
dates.
• Developed Tableau dashboards to visualize insights like total bookings and gross booking value by
service and most booked routes, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decision
